### 1. Cost of Downtime

- The global average cost of downtime is approximately $150,000 per hour.
- Downtime affects not only revenue but also damages brand trust and user experience.

### 2. Observability vs Monitoring

| Monitoring               | Observability                         |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Identifies what is wrong | Helps understand why it is wrong       |
| Uses metrics and alerts  | Utilizes logs, metrics, and traces     |
| Reactive                 | Diagnostic and proactive               |

*Example:* Monitoring is like a car dashboard; observability is like a full diagnostic system.

### 3. Golden Signals (SRE)

1. **Traffic** – Number of requests.  
2. **Errors** – Failed or problematic transactions.  
3. **Latency** – Response time.  
4. **Saturation** – System load or capacity.

### 4. SRE Concepts

- **MTTD** (Mean Time to Detect) and **MTTR** (Mean Time to Repair) are critical for system reliability.
- A high rate of recurring incidents suggests poor root cause analysis and excessive manual work.

### 5. Instrumentation

- Collect telemetry data at the code level, manually or using tools like OpenTelemetry.
- Enables detailed performance insights across services.

### 6. Core Pillars of Observability

| Data Type | Purpose                                        |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------|
| Metrics   | Quantitative data over time (e.g., CPU usage) |
| Logs      | Timestamped event records (e.g., errors)      |
| Traces    | Request lifecycle across services             |

### 7. OpenTelemetry

- Vendor-neutral standard for collecting logs, metrics, and traces.
- Enables consistent instrumentation across platforms.

### 8. Topology and Service Maps

- Visualize service dependencies and interactions.
- Identify failure points and performance bottlenecks.

### 9. Anomaly Detection

- Uses ML to detect abnormal patterns in metrics or behavior.
- Detects issues like traffic surges or error spikes before user impact.

### 10. Observability Maturity Model

| Level | Name                    | Description                                              |
|-------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Monitoring              | Basic metrics and alerting                               |
| 2     | Observability           | Unified logs, metrics, and traces                        |
| 3     | Causal Observability    | Ability to identify root causes and full service flow    |
| 4     | Proactive Observability | Predictive, automated detection and issue resolution     |

## Stakeholder Use Cases

| Role          | Application                                    |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Developers    | Debugging and performance tuning              |
| SREs          | Service level management and automation       |
| Architects    | Visualize dependencies and optimize design    |
| Business Team | SLA tracking and impact visibility            |

## Key Takeaways

- Observability enables in-depth root cause analysis beyond alerts.
- Faster MTTD leads to faster MTTR and reduced downtime.
- OpenTelemetry is becoming the industry standard.
- Tools like service maps and anomaly detection are essential in modern observability.
- A mature observability approach allows for proactive and automated issue handling.

## Next Steps

- Begin using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, or OpenTelemetry.
- Apply Golden Signal monitoring in your environment.
- Reduce MTTR through automation and better diagnostics.
- Standardize telemetry collection across teams and platforms.
