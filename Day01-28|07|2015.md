### 1. Cost of Downtime

- The global average cost of downtime is approximately $150,000 per hour.
- Downtime impacts revenue, damages brand trust, and reduces customer satisfaction.
- In critical industries (e.g., finance, healthcare), downtime can have legal and reputational consequences.

### 2. Observability vs Monitoring

| Monitoring               | Observability                         |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Identifies what is wrong | Helps understand why it is wrong       |
| Uses metrics and alerts  | Utilizes logs, metrics, and traces     |
| Reactive                 | Diagnostic and proactive               |

*Example:* Monitoring shows CPU usage is high; observability helps determine which service caused it, why, and how to fix it.

### 3. Golden Signals (SRE)

These four signals help identify the health of distributed systems:

1. **Traffic** – Volume of requests the system handles.
2. **Errors** – Frequency of failed requests or exceptions.
3. **Latency** – Time taken to process requests.
4. **Saturation** – How full the system resources (CPU, memory, etc.) are.

*Using Golden Signals ensures you're monitoring what's most critical to users.*

### 4. SRE Concepts

- **MTTD (Mean Time to Detect):** Measures how quickly a system detects an issue.
- **MTTR (Mean Time to Repair):** Measures how long it takes to resolve the issue.
- **Low MTTD and MTTR** are signs of mature operational excellence.
- Recurring issues may indicate a lack of automation, poor alerting, or inadequate RCA.

### 5. Instrumentation

- Involves adding code or using agents to generate telemetry data.
- Can be manual (custom instrumentation) or automatic (using libraries/agents).
- Tools: OpenTelemetry, Prometheus exporters, FluentBit, etc.
- Ensures visibility from backend code to frontend behavior.

### 6. Core Pillars of Observability

| Data Type | Description                                    | Example                        |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Metrics   | Numeric values over time                       | CPU %, request count, latency |
| Logs      | Structured/unstructured event records          | Error logs, audit trails       |
| Traces    | End-to-end journey of a single request         | A user’s API call flow         |

*Together, they help detect, diagnose, and resolve issues faster.*

### 7. OpenTelemetry

- Open-source and vendor-neutral.
- Supports standard formats for metrics, logs, and traces.
- Works across languages and platforms (Java, Python, Node.js, etc.).
- Helps reduce vendor lock-in and simplifies toolchain integration.

### 8. Topology and Service Maps

- Represent microservice relationships and data flows.
- Help identify upstream/downstream impact during an outage.
- Visual tools like New Relic, Datadog, and Dynatrace provide real-time topology mapping.

### 9. Anomaly Detection

- Uses statistical models or machine learning to detect behavior outside normal patterns.
- Helps catch silent failures or degraded performance before alerts are triggered.
- Common algorithms: time-series forecasting, change point detection, etc.

### 10. Observability Maturity Model

| Level | Name                    | Description                                                  |
|-------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Monitoring              | Basic metrics and alerts                                     |
| 2     | Observability           | Centralized telemetry (logs, metrics, traces)                |
| 3     | Causal Observability    | Ability to trace root cause across distributed systems       |
| 4     | Proactive Observability | Predictive insights, automation, and self-healing responses  |

## Stakeholder Use Cases

| Role          | Use Case                                                             |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Developers    | Understand failures, optimize latency, and debug across services     |
| SREs          | Set and monitor SLIs/SLOs, reduce MTTR, automate recovery            |
| Architects    | Analyze dependencies, plan scaling, manage tech debt                 |
| Business Team | Ensure SLA compliance, understand user experience, justify ROI       |

## Key Takeaways

- Observability is critical for modern, distributed, cloud-native systems.
- It's more than monitoring—it enables deeper, faster understanding and action.
- Standardizing with tools like OpenTelemetry allows vendor-agnostic visibility.
- Integrating telemetry into the SDLC helps shift observability left.
- The maturity model guides teams from reactive monitoring to proactive insight.
