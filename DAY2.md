# 📡 Observability Onboarding Guide for SRE

This guide helps application developers and SREs understand the **observability requirements** for onboarding applications into an SRE-managed platform. It breaks down key concepts, tools, and standards with examples.

## 🔍 What is Observability?

Observability is the ability to **understand the internal state of a system** using its **external outputs** such as logs, metrics, and traces.

> ✅ Goal: Know *why* something broke, not just *that* it broke.

## 🏗️ The Three Pillars of Observability

### 1. 📊 Metrics
- Numeric values (CPU %, request count, error rate).
- Used for: Dashboards, alerts, SLIs.
- Types: Counters, Gauges, Histograms.

### 2. 📄 Logs
- Text events emitted by the app.
- Structured format (JSON) required for analysis.
- Example:
```json
{ "event": "login_failed", "user_id": 5, "error": "invalid_password", "level": "warn" }
```

### 3. 🔗 Traces
- Follow a request through multiple services.
- Used to identify bottlenecks and latencies.

## 🧰 Centralized Observability Stack

| Tool            | Purpose                  |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
| **Fluentd**     | Log collection and routing |
| **Elasticsearch** | Storage and indexing     |
| **Kibana**      | Search and dashboards     |

---

## 🛠️ Logging Standards for Onboarding

### ✅ Must-Haves
- Logs must go to **stdout** or a known file.
- Logs must be in **structured JSON** format.
- Every log must have a **log level** (`info`, `warn`, `error`).
- Must support **configurable log levels**.

### ⚠️ Should-Haves
- **Hot reload** for log level changes (no restart).
- Add **contextual fields**: `user_id`, `request_id`, `region`, etc.

### 💡 Could-Haves
- Include **event types**, **categories**, `env`, `region`, etc.
- Support **log correlation** (with traces).

## 🚫 Bad vs ✅ Good Logging

| ❌ Bad Example                      | ✅ Good Example                          |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `Login failed for user 5`          | `{ "event": "login_failed", "user_id": 5, "level": "warn" }` |
| No structure, hard to parse        | Structured, machine-readable             |
| Multiline logs break analysis      | One-line structured entries              |

---

## 📈 Kibana Dashboards

With structured logs, you can visualize:
- Errors over time
- Log levels per service
- Search logs by user, request ID, event type

---

## 🎯 Why it Matters

- **Faster debugging** (Root Cause Analysis)
- **Efficient search & alerting**
- **Better SRE automation & scaling**
- **Reliable production monitoring**

---

## ✅ Quick Recap

| Pillar  | Use Case                  |
|---------|---------------------------|
| Metrics | Health, trends, alerts    |
| Logs    | Event-level diagnosis     |
| Traces  | Request-level performance |

---

## 📚 Next Steps

- Implement structured logging in your application
- Integrate with Fluentd → Elasticsearch → Kibana
- Align with SRE onboarding standards

Happy Observing 🚀
